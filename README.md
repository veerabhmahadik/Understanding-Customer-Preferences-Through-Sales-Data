# Understanding-Customer-Preferences-Through-Sales-Data
This project analyzes sales data to understand customer preferences, identify top-selling products, and optimize sales strategies. It uses Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and itertools to uncover  key trends such as peak sales months, high-revenue cities, and the best times for targeted advertisements.

# **Understanding Customer Preferences Through Sales Data**

## **Objective**
This project analyzes sales data to uncover key customer preferences, identify top-selling products, and optimize sales strategies. Merging and cleaning 12 months of sales data provides insights into revenue trends, high-revenue locations, optimal advertising times, and frequently purchased product combinations.

## **Questions Answered**
1. **What was the best month for sales? How much revenue was generated?**
   - Identifies the month with the highest sales and revenue generated.
2. **Which city had the highest sales?**
   - Determines the city contributing the most to total sales.
3. **What time should advertisements be displayed to maximize sales?**
   - Analyzes sales trends by time of day to suggest optimal ad placement.
4. **What products are often sold together?**
   - Identifies commonly purchased product bundles for cross-selling opportunities.
5. **Which product was the most popular, and why?**
   - Examines the highest-selling product and possible reasons behind its popularity.

## **Software Requirements**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or any Python-supported IDE
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, itertools, Counter** (for data processing and visualization)
- **CSV files** containing sales data(Data Folder in this repository) for analysis

## **Libraries Used**
